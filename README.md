# Smallsh

Smallsh is a mini shell program written in C that utilizes the Unix process API.

# Program Functionality

## The Command Prompt

The colon : symbol is the prompt for each command line.

The general syntax of a command line is:

```bash
command [arg1 arg2 ...] [< input_file] [> output_file] [&]
```

â€¦where items in square brackets are optional.

A command is made up of words separated by spaces. The special symbols <, > and & are recognized, but they must be surrounded by spaces like other words.

### Background Execution

If the command is to be executed in the background, the last word must be &. If the & character appears anywhere else, just treat it as normal text.

### Redirection

If standard input or output is to be redirected, the > or < words followed by a filename word must appear after all the arguments. Input redirection can appear before or after output redirection.

### Limits

Shell supports command lines with a maximum length of 2048 characters, and a maximum of 512 arguments.

### Comments

Any line that begins with the # character is a comment line and should be ignored. Mid-line comments, such as the C-style //, will not be supported.

### Blank Lines

A blank line (one without any commands) does nothing and will just re-prompt for another command.

### Expansion of Variable $$

The shell expands any instance of "$$" in a command into the process ID of the smallsh itself.

## Built-in Commands

The shell supports three built-in commands: exit, cd, and status. All others are simply passed on to a member of the exec() family of functions.

An attempt to run one of these built-in commands in the background with the & option will ignore that option and run the command in the foreground anyway.

### exit

The exit command exits your shell and kill any other processes or jobs that the shell has started before it terminates itself.

### cd

The cd command changes the working directory of the shell.

By itself - with no arguments - it changes to the directory specified in the HOME environment variable (This is typically not the location where smallsh was executed from, unless your shell executable is located in the HOME directory, in which case these are the same.).

This command can also take one argument: the path of a directory to change to. The shell supports both absolute and relative paths.

### status

The status command prints out either the exit status or the terminating signal of the last foreground process ran by the shell.

If this command is run before any foreground command is run, then it simply returns the exit status 0.

The three built-in shell commands do not count as foreground processes for the purposes of this built-in command - i.e., status should ignore built-in commands.

### Executing Other Commands

The shell executes any commands other than the 3 built-in command by using fork(), exec() and waitpid()

Whenever a non-built in command is received, the parent (i.e., smallsh) will fork off a child. The child will use a function from the exec() family of functions to run the command.

If a command fails because the shell could not find the command to run, then the shell will print an error message and set the exit status to 1.

The child process terminates after running a command (whether the command is successful or it fails).

## Input & Output Redirection

### Input

An input file is opened for reading only. If the shell cannot open the file for reading, it will print an error message and set the exit status to 1 (but will not exit the shell).

### Output

An output file is opened for writing only. The file will be truncated if it already exists or created if it does not exist.

If the shell cannot open the output file it will print an error message and set the exit status to 1 but will not exit the shell.

Both stdin and stdout for a command can be redirected at the same time (see example below).

## Executing Commands in Foreground & Background

### Foreground Commands

Any command without an & at the end is run as a foreground command and the shell will wait for the completion of the command before prompting for the next command.

For such commands, the parent shell does NOT return command line access and control to the user until the child terminates.

### Background Commands

Any non built-in command with an & at the end will be run as a background command and the shell must not wait for such a command to complete.

For such commands, the parent will return command line access and control to the user immediately after forking off the child. The shell will print the process id of a background process when it begins.

When a background process terminates, a message showing the process id and exit status will be printed.

## Signals SIGINT & SIGTSTP

### SIGINT

A CTRL-C command from the keyboard sends a SIGINT signal to the parent process and all children at the same time (this is a built-in part of Linux).

Your shell's parent process and any children running as a background process ignores SIGINT.

A child running as a foreground process will terminate itself when it receives SIGINT.
The parent does not attempt to terminate the foreground child process; instead the foreground child (if any) will terminate itself on receipt of this signal.

If a child foreground process is killed by a signal, the parent will immediately print out the number of the signal that killed it's foreground child process (see the example) before prompting the user for the next command.

### SIGTSTP

A CTRL-Z command from the keyboard sends a SIGTSTP signal to the parent shell process and all children at the same time (this is a built-in part of Linux).

A child, if any, running as a background or foreground process will ignore SIGTSTP.

When the parent process running the shell receives SIGTSTP the shell will display an informative message (see below) immediately if it's sitting at the prompt, or immediately after any currently running foreground process has terminated.

The shell then enters a state where subsequent commands can no longer be run in the background. In this state, the & operator is simply ignored, i.e., all such commands are run as if they were foreground processes.

If the user sends SIGTSTP again, then the shell will display another informative message (see below) immediately after any currently running foreground process terminates. The shell then returns back to the normal condition where the & operator is once again honored for subsequent commands, allowing them to be executed in the background.

See the example below for usage and the exact syntax which you must use for these two informative messages.

# Sample Program Execution

Here is an example run using smallsh. Note that CTRL-C has no effect towards the bottom of the example, when it's used while sitting at the command prompt:

```bash
$ smallsh
: ls
junk   smallsh    smallsh.c
: ls > junk
: status
exit value 0
: cat junk
junk
smallsh
smallsh.c
: wc < junk > junk2
: wc < junk
       3       3      23
: test -f badfile
: status
exit value 1
: wc < badfile
cannot open badfile for input
: status
exit value 1
: badfile
badfile: no such file or directory
: sleep 5
